# Neural Memory Graph - Development Roadmap

## Current Status: Phase 2 - Performance & Quality (In Progress)

**Last Updated:** January 27, 2026  
**Deployment:** Production-ready implementation  
**Current Stats:** 256 nodes, 17,500+ edges, activation normalized

---

## 🔥 HIGH PRIORITY (Expert Feedback - Jan 27, 2026)

### ✅ 1. ANN Indexing (COMPLETE)
**Status:** Implemented and deployed  
**Commit:** dcb7d32  
**Achievement:** O(log n) similarity search using FAISS IndexFlatIP  
- Replaced linear O(n) scan with approximate nearest neighbor search
- IndexFlatIP for normalized vectors (Inner Product = cosine similarity)
- Auto-rebuild index on server startup
- Fallback to linear scan if ANN disabled
- **Result:** Faster search, especially for 500+ nodes

### ✅ 2. Activation Normalization + Damping (COMPLETE)
**Status:** Implemented and deployed  
**Commit:** 6b4b9e9  
**Problem:** Activation scores grew unbounded (2520+) causing poor ranking  
**Solution:** Normalize to 0-1 range after each spreading iteration
- Scale all activations by max value → max always = 1.0
- Apply decay factor before spreading
- Debug logging for iteration diagnostics
- **Result:** Scores bounded (2.5 vs 2520), stable across iterations

### ⏳ 3. Enhanced spaCy Entity Extraction (NEXT)
**Status:** Planned  
**Goal:** Improve entity recognition quality using existing spaCy in Docker  
**Tasks:**
- Expand entity types beyond PERSON, ORG, LOC
- Add custom patterns for technical terms (e.g., "Python", "Docker", "FAISS")
- Implement entity coreference (e.g., "Claude" = "I" in context)
- Consider neuralcoref for pronoun resolution
- Add entity confidence scores
**Estimated:** 1-2 hours  
**Benefit:** 80% of LLM quality with zero overhead (spaCy already installed)  
**Files:** `src/entity_extractor.py`

### ⏳ 4. Tests Infrastructure (pytest)
**Status:** Planned  
**Goal:** Automated testing for reliability
**Tasks:**
- Unit tests for graph_engine.py (spreading activation)
- Integration tests for MCP tools
- Test fixtures with sample graph data
- CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions)
**Estimated:** 2-3 hours

## 🎯 MEDIUM PRIORITY

### 5. Incremental Updates
- Update existing nodes without full rebuild
- Add single vectors to ANN index without recreation

### 6. Edge Pruning
- Remove weak semantic connections (similarity < threshold)
- Optimize graph structure for better spreading

### 7. Graph Metrics
- PageRank for node importance
- Community detection (Louvain algorithm)
- Centrality measures

### 8. Search Quality Metrics
- Recall@k measurement
- Precision tracking
- User feedback collection

### 9. LLM-based Entity Extraction (Optional)
**Note:** Moved from HIGH to MEDIUM priority  
**Reason:** Massive overhead for personal use case
- Ollama requires 3-7GB Docker image
- 4-12GB RAM constant usage
- 2-5 seconds per note (vs 100ms with spaCy)
- For 200-500 notes, spaCy is pragmatic choice
**Alternative:** Remote Claude API for critical cases only

## 🏢 Phase 4: Enterprise Features (FUTURE - For Production Use)

*Note: Current implementation is optimized for personal use (~200-1000 notes). The following features would be required for enterprise deployment at scale.*

### Graph Analytics & Intelligence
- [ ] **Centrality Analysis** - Identify key nodes using PageRank, betweenness centrality
- [ ] **Community Detection** - Automatic clustering of related knowledge domains
- [ ] **Path Scoring** - Weighted pathfinding between concepts
- [ ] **Graph Metrics Dashboard** - Network density, diameter, clustering coefficient
- [ ] **Anomaly Detection** - Identify orphaned or over-connected nodes

**Why:** At enterprise scale (10k+ notes), understanding network structure becomes critical for knowledge discovery and organization.

### Memory Hierarchy & Lifecycle
- [ ] **Short-term Memory** - Session-based working memory (24h retention)
- [ ] **Long-term Memory** - Permanent storage with reinforcement learning
- [ ] **Working Memory Cache** - Recently accessed nodes in fast storage
- [ ] **Memory Consolidation** - Automated archival of stale content
- [ ] **Access-based Promotion** - Frequently used short-term → long-term

**Why:** Mimics human memory architecture; improves performance by tiering storage based on access patterns.

### Architectural Improvements
- [ ] **Layer Separation** - Clean boundaries between ingestion/storage/retrieval/reasoning
- [ ] **Service-Oriented Architecture** - Separate microservices for each layer
- [ ] **Event-Driven Processing** - Async message queues for note processing
- [ ] **CQRS Pattern** - Separate read/write models for scaling
- [ ] **API Gateway** - Unified entry point with rate limiting, auth

**Why:** Current architecture mixes concerns for simplicity; enterprise needs clean separation for maintainability and scaling.

### Security & Compliance
- [ ] **Multi-tenancy** - Isolated memory spaces per user/organization
- [ ] **Role-based Access Control** - Granular permissions on notes/categories
- [ ] **Audit Logging** - Track all changes with timestamp/user
- [ ] **Encryption at Rest** - Database-level encryption
- [ ] **SOC 2 Compliance** - Security controls and audits

**Why:** Enterprise data governance and regulatory requirements.

### Observability & Operations
- [ ] **Distributed Tracing** - Request flow across services
- [ ] **Prometheus Metrics** - Query latency, throughput, cache hit rates
- [ ] **Structured Logging** - Centralized log aggregation (ELK stack)
- [ ] **Health Checks** - Deep health monitoring beyond simple ping
- [ ] **Auto-scaling** - Horizontal pod autoscaling based on load

**Why:** Production operations require deep visibility into system behavior.

### Performance at Scale
- [ ] **Vector Index Optimization** - HNSW/IVF-PQ for large-scale similarity search
- [ ] **Read Replicas** - Database replication for read-heavy workloads
- [ ] **Connection Pooling** - Efficient database connection management
- [ ] **Materialized Views** - Pre-computed graph metrics
- [ ] **CDN for Static Assets** - Distributed caching

**Why:** Current SQLite + in-memory FAISS works for personal use but won't scale to millions of notes.

### Estimated Effort
- **Graph Analytics**: 2-3 weeks
- **Memory Hierarchy**: 3-4 weeks
- **Architecture Refactor**: 4-6 weeks
- **Security/Compliance**: 2-3 weeks
- **Observability**: 1-2 weeks
- **Performance Optimization**: 2-3 weeks

**Total: ~3-4 months** for enterprise-ready production deployment


- [ ] Migrate from Flask development server to production WSGI (Gunicorn)
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling and retry logic
- [ ] Implement rate limiting for MCP endpoints
- [ ] Add structured logging with log levels
- [ ] Security audit for production deployment
- [ ] Performance profiling and optimization
- [ ] Automated testing suite (unit + integration)
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline
