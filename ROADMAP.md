# HippoGraph Roadmap

This project has **two roadmaps** for different use cases:

## [Personal Roadmap](ROADMAP_PERSONAL.md)
For single-user, self-hosted deployment. Focus on search quality, research, and zero-LLM-cost operation.

**Next priorities:** BM25 hybrid search, reranking, LOCOMO benchmark.

## [Enterprise Roadmap](ROADMAP_ENTERPRISE.md)
For multi-user, production deployment. Features from competitive analysis (Mem0, Zep, Letta, doobidoo).

**Key gaps:** Multi-tenant, cloud sync, LLM-optional entity extraction.

---

**Current focus:** Personal roadmap. Enterprise is aspirational.
