# HippoGraph Roadmap

This project has **two separate roadmaps** for different use cases:

---

## 📱 [ROADMAP_PERSONAL.md](ROADMAP_PERSONAL.md) ← **Current Focus**

**For:** Single user, 200-2,000 notes, personal knowledge management

**Priorities:**
- Entity extraction quality
- Note versioning
- Security tiers (localhost default)
- Graph visualization
- Retrieval quality testing

**Philosophy:** Keep all memories, practical over perfect, secure by default

---

## 🏢 [ROADMAP_ENTERPRISE.md](ROADMAP_ENTERPRISE.md) ← **Future Work**

**For:** Production deployment, multi-user, 10k+ notes per user

**Includes:**
- Multi-tenancy & authentication
- Advanced graph algorithms (PageRank, GraphSAGE)
- Neo4j integration
- Horizontal scaling
- Federation

**Status:** Deferred until personal use case is solid

## 🎯 Current Development

We are **focused on ROADMAP_PERSONAL.md** to make HippoGraph:
1. Reliable for daily use
2. Secure by default
3. Easy to understand and navigate
4. High signal-to-noise ratio

Enterprise features will be addressed **after** personal use case is proven and stable.
